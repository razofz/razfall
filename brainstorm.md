# Brainstorming

## Do a simple web app with Flask

paths needed for that:

- /
    - here input number of players
    - start button, goes to
    | 
    v
- /give_roles
    - (here iterate through list)
        - do that by sending current player nbr,
        receive that in the backend and send back the next 
        player's info.
        When all players' info is transmitted, go to 
        |
        v
- /possible_places
    - a list of all possible places, to display
    e. g. when all roles have been communicated
