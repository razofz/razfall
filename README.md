# RAZFALL

For when you want more (and possibly _funkier_) places.

This was mostly coded in one night, after a board game night in Munich playing
[Spyfall](https://spyfall.crabhat.com/). On the U-bahn home inspiration for
more places struck, and instead of going to sleep when I came home I made a
very bare-bones implementation of the Spyfall game. Since I made it, the
obvious name (at least obvious to me at ~1 AM) was _**razfall**_.
